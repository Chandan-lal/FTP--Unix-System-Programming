File Transfer Protocol- RFC - 959

FTP stands for the File transfer protocol and is used to transfer files between an FTP server and another computer. In the past, FTP was much more common than it is today and was the dominant file transfer mechanism on the Internet. If you needed to transfer files between two computers, you would use FTP to do so. FTP is still very popular today when a service requires that a lot of files be hosted for other to people to download. FTP also tends to be faster than other contemporary methods of transferring files because it was designed to do so.

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an application layer protocol which moves files between local and remote file systems. It runs on the top of TCP, like HTTP. To transfer a file, 2 TCP connections are used by FTP in parallel: control connection and data connection.



## Execution
*Install java on your Ubuntu terminal or subsystem.

* First run the server program by using the command: 
  ***sudo java server.java***

* We are using port 21 to run FTP. All ports under port 1024 are privileged port. Hence we need root access to run it.  

* Then run the client program by using the command:
  ***java client.java***

* Then you can give commands to the programs on the client side.
